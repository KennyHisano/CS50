0.  How many different colors does each format support?
    BMP = 16,777,216 colors
    GIF = 256 colors
    JPEG = 16,777,216 colors
    PNG = 281,474,976,710,656 colors
    
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently deleting some information,
    on the other hand lossless compression makes all bits remained so that all 
    of the information is restorable. 
    

3.  JPEG

4.  The system modifies the filename’s first character in the file’s directory
    entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry
    can be recycled.On the same time, the system moves all of the file’s FAT
    clusters to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. 

5.  Use a proper sanitization tool which modify disk blocks as invalid.

6.  It declares specified integer types as having a certain width.

7.  It specifies what kind of data you want.

8.  BYTE = 1 byte
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    WORD = 2 bytes

9.  BM

10. bfSize is entire size of data in bytes.
    biSize is for image header. it is size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure 
    given in bytes.

11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at
    the upper left corner.

12. biBitCount

13. It may be null when os does not have enough memory or when there is no 
    permission to access the dictionary the file is in.

14. The third argument suggest the number of element. Since this time we run
    use fread each 1 time, it is fine.

15. 3 pixels

16. Set the file position indicator for the stream to a new position.

17. It indicates the offset is relative to the current file position.
